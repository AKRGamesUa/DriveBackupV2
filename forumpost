== What is this? ==

Have you ever lost your world before?

Maybe your hard drive died. Maybe you used a web hosting service that terminated without warning. Maybe you just accidentally deleted it.

DriveBackup is a plugin that aims to provide an extra layer of security to your data.

=== What does it do? ===
* Creates and uploads backups to Google Drive
* Can create a backup out of any folder in the root directory
* If you already have a utility creating certain backups (eg. world) you can choose not to create that kind of backup and instead upload the existing ones

=== What does it not do? ===
* At the moment, it cannot upload to anything but Google Drive. OneDrive will likely be implemented in the future
* At the moment, uploading to Google Drive can't be disabled.

=== How do I use it? ===
Setup is a little bit tricky if your server doesn't have a UI, as Google Drive requires an oauth2 authentication to upload files to your account. You have two options:

==== Option 1 ====
Run the plugin on a computer with a UI. Run the backup command. The plugin will open a webpage asking for permission to use your Google Drive. After saying 'allow', copy the StoredCredential file from the plugins/DriveBackup folder onto your server's plugins/DriveBackup folder.

==== Option 2 ====
I have made a companion program to generate the StoredCredential file without running the plugin. It is available [[https://github.com/Ratismal/DriveCredentials/releases|here]]. Simply extract, run the .bat file, and follow the instructions. Afterwards, copy the StoredCredential file into the plugins/DriveBackup folder.

==== After That ====
Make sure to do the config! You need to direct it to the backup folder, and give it the naming format that your backups are in. Instructions can be found in the config file.

== Commands ==
* /drivebackup
** base command, shows a list of commands - drivebackup
* /drivebackup v
** displays plugin version - drivebackup
* drivebackup reloadconfig
** reloads configs - drivebackup.reloadconfig
* /drivebackup backup
** uploads backup to Google Drive - drivebackup.backup

== Config ==
The default config file can be found [[http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/drivebackup/pages/config/|here]].

== Metrics ==
This plugin uses [[https://bukkit.org/threads/mcstats-plugin-metrics-r7-easy-advanced-plugin-statistics.77352/|Metrics]] for anonymous usage statistics collections. You can opt out of the statistics collection for this plugin specifically at any time by disabling it in the config. You can opt out of Metrics altogether by editing plugins/Plugin Metrics/config.yml and changing the "opt-out" node to true.You can view the collected statistics at [[http://mcstats.org/plugin/DriveBackup|mcstats.org/plugin/DriveBackup]]. Collected stats are:
* General Stats (How many total servers use the plugin, and the combined number of players on all the servers)
* Server Location
* Metrics Version
* Minecraft Version
* Java Version
* Operating System (Version, name, architecture)
* System Core Count
* Server Version
* Whether the server is on offline or online mode

== Found a bug? ==
If something goes wrong, let me know! You can post a comment here, but I'd much prefer if you made a ticket [[https://github.com/Ratismal/DriveBackup/issues|on my github repo]]. Thanks!

== Disclaimers ==
This project needs access to your Google Drive in order to upload files. The plugin will NOT do anything besides upload files and create a backup folder to put the files in if necessary. This project is open source, so if you have any questions as to what this project does or how it does it you can always check the source [[https://github.com/Ratismal/DriveBackup|here]]. Use at your own risk.

I will never charge money for my plugins. If you want to support me, feel free to [[https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=F35SLEM7AV4G8|donate here]].
