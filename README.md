# Privacy Policy
Since we need to access your Google Drive data in order to back up your world, we are required to privide a Privacy Policy.
 
All of the data this plugin uploads and downloads from your Google Drive stays on your Minecraft server, so we never have access to it. This plugin will not access any data in your Google Drive that is not related to backing up your Minecraft world backups. But don't take our word for it, all of this plugin's source code is available here!
